## Helmet-detection using YOLO 

**Project Overview**
This project aims to detect helmets in images and videos using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The primary objective is to enhance safety by ensuring that individuals are wearing helmets in various environments, such as construction sites or while riding motorcycles.


### Features
- Real-time Detection: Utilizes the YOLO model to detect helmets in real-time from video feeds or images.

- High Accuracy: Trained on a diverse dataset to achieve high accuracy in detecting helmets.

- Scalability: Can be extended to detect other safety equipment like gloves or safety glasses.

- Visualization: Provides annotated images and videos with detected helmets highlighted.
